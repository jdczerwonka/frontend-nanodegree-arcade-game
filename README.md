Project Title: Arcade Game

Project Purpose: To complete the third project requirements for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree as laid out by Udacity.

Project Description: This project creates a simple arcade for the user to play by using three JavaScript files to manipulate an
HTML5 canvas.  The goal of this game is to collect as many gems as possible without colliding with any enemies/bugs.

Project Instructions:  To launch the game open the index.html file.  This will open a tab in your web browser and the game will
begin.  Use the arrow keys to navigate the game landscape, pick up gems, and avoid oncoming bugs.  The rows of grass are 
safe zones.  Once the game is over, reload the web browser to start again.
